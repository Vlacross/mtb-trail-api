mtb-trail-api is a simple API fetch request project.

https://vlacross.github.io/

This app lets the user search for mountain bike trails near (or within a specified vicinity);

A location is entered along with a distance in miles(from the location specified),
 and a list of local trails is returned, each with a button to show the current 
   weather.

If the user wants to search a second location, there is a tab at the top to search again.
